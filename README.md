Activity Tracker
================

This is an activity tracker extension for Chromium. It logs Web usage for time concious people and can be used for analysing amount of time spend on different websites.

*NOTE* This extension just works and lacks a lot of functionality and UI, as it is still under (slow?) development. Contributions are more than welcome!

CHANGELOG
---------

Version 1.1

	* Duplicated time logging for multiple windows
	* Stopped time logging when window out of focus.
